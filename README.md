## MORE ABOUT

### One page website

I choosed to develop a One page website for my portfolio. To optimize the user experience, I used React-scroll to navigate with smooth scrolling in the page.
Difficulty were to optimize the active class update in the navigation while scrolling. The library hook active weren't optimized. So I had to define each section zone by using React useStates, useEffects, section offsetHeight and position scroll Y while scrolling.
And it work pretty well !

### Framer Motion :

I didn't learn this wonderful animation library during my studies. I discovered it with this project.
Framer Motion is powerful and I used it to implement smooth and subtiles animations triggered on scroll.
I'm a motion lover, so it was very pleasant to play with these composants and hooks.

Feel free to give me feedback and advices. I know I'm just at the beginning of my development exploration :-)
